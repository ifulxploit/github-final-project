A Code of Conduct sets clear guidelines for the expected behavior of all participants in the project. It helps maintain a positive, respectful, and inclusive community by defining standards for interactions.

GitHub provides ready-made templates such as the "Contributor Covenant" to easily add a Code of Conduct to your repository.

To add this file, create a new file named `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in the root folder of your repository and use the Contributor Covenant template.

Once added, check your repositoryâ€™s homepage to confirm the file exists.
